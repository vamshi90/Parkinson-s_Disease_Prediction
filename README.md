# Parkinson-s_Disease_Prediction

This publication describes a genome-wide association study on Parkinson's Disease. More than 408,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were measured (or genotyped) across 276 patients with Parkinsonâ€™s Disease, and 276 normal control individuals. Each SNP is a potentially differing nucleotide between individuals. Recall that there are estimated to be as many as 10 million SNPs in the human genome, so this collection does not encompass all of them.
The main objective of the project is to infer the likelihood of the genotype at the locus to be significantly different for individuals with & without the disease to analyze the probability of the disease
